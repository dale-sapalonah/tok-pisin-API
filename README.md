# tok-pisin-API
Simple Python API using FastAPI and JSON



This personal project aims to create a simple API that will return a word/phrase in English when a Tok Pisin word is passed into the defined
API endpoint. It is basically a dictionary of sorts that attempts at making the rather obscure Papua New Guinea language accessible to anyone
who wishes to understand it.

I am learning as I build so I acknowledge that there is a long way to go in terms of Python best practices and mastery of the many technologies/frameworks
that go into building such a project in a more robust and secure manner.
